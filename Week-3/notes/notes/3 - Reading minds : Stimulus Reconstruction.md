Stimulus Re-construction
```
```
Imagine that this is our Spike Triggered Average (STA).
Everytime when there is a spike, the spike train is being measured.
```

```
As the spike train is measured and as the firing rate keeps going.
Results will be...from lower to higher firing rate.

```
This will create issues.
```
```
The fly has two blah-blah neurons...
One that encodes the left motion..
And the another that encodes the right motion..

We can also reconstruct velocity with both positive and negative inputs.

Another experiment

```
Question:
In this experiment, what do r and s represent?
Answer:
the fMRI signal, the video clip
Explanation:
r represents the response, in this case brain activity. 
s represents the stimuli that elicited that brain activity. 
In this case, the fMRI was used to measure the brain activity, and the video clips were used to elicit it. 
How would you figure out the dimensionalities of the vectors r and s?
