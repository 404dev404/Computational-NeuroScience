Either any one of the MATLAB (OR) Python is enough to compute the solution... <br>
For now, I have generated solutions in <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/Computational-NeuroScience/tree/master/Week-2/Quiz/Programming/solutions/mathlab">MATLAB</a>. <br> <br>
I'll be generating for Python 3.4.3.2 later on... <br> <br>
Hint: Both MATLAB and Python are same... <br>
Requires only few additional lines to be coded along with the shared codes provided by the instructors.
