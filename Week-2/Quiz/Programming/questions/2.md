<b>Question:</b>
```
We wish to compute the spike-triggered average for this neuron over a window of width 300 ms. 
Suppose we do not care about the value exactly 300 ms before the spike. 
How many elements (time steps) will be in our resulting spike-triggered average vector? 
Set the variable named num_timesteps in quiz2.m (quiz2.py) equal to this value and enter it below.

Hint: Your answer should be an even number.
