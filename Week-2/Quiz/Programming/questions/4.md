<b>Question:</b>
```
Now we may compute the spike-triggered average. 
To do this, add code to compute_sta. 
Remember that the spike-triggered average is the element-wise mean of the time windows starting 300 ms before (exclusive) and ending 0 ms before a spike. 

Note that we have given you code to find all of the indices in the stimulus vector that correspond to the spike times (labeled as the variable spike_times in compute_sta).

Which of these plots most closely matches the spike-triggered average for this data set?
