<b>Question:</b>
```
The data set we have given you is comprised of a stimulus vector (named stim) and a binary vector (named rho). 
These two vectors are the same length because they represent measurements of two different quantities over the same time period. 
The binary vector has a 1 if a spike occurred in the time bin corresponding to the that index and a 0 otherwise. 
The sampling rate for the data set was 500 Hz.

How many milliseconds are there between adjacent samples (what is the sampling period)? Only enter the number, not the units. 
If your answer is not an integer, round to the nearest integer value. 
Set the variable named sampling_period in quiz2.m (quiz2.py) equal to this value.
```
