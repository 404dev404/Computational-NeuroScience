<b>Question:</b>
```
In order to calculate the average, it is necessary for us to know how many time windows (stimulus vectors) we are averaging over. This is equal to the number of observed spikes. Write code to calculate the total number of spikes in the data set c1p8.mat. 
How many spikes were observed in this recording? 
You should not count any spikes that occur before 300 ms from the beginning of the recording.

Set the variable named num_spikes in compute_sta equal to this value, 
or (better yet) use the expression/variable/code you used to calculate this value and set it equal to num_spikes so that your code will work for any set of parameters (different sampling rate, different time window in which average is calculated etc.) passed to compute_sta.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```matlab
Hint ---

rho = mat['rho'][num_timesteps:]

spike_times = rho.nonzero()[0]
num_spikes = spike_times.size
print(num_spikes)
```
