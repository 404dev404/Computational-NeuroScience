<b>Question:</b>
```
What is the nature of this neuron? That is, what mathematical operation of the stimulus does it compute?

(i) Differentiation.
(ii) Running average/sum.
(iii) No response.
(iv) Leaky integration.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
<br><br>
<b>this neuron</b> refers to the one that was computed <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/Computational-NeuroScience/blob/master/Week-2/Quiz/Programming/solutions/mathlab/output.md">as an output</a> in the programming question.<br>
This is more like temporal filtering that is more like leaky integration. <br>
