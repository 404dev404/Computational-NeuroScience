<b>Question:</b>
```
Which of the following stimuli would you expect this neuron to respond most strongly to? 
You may assume that all non-zero values of the stimulus have the same magnitude. 
That is, assume that all positive stimuli have a value of c and all negative stimuli have a value of âˆ’c where c>0.

(i) No difference.
(ii) A constant positive value.
(iii) A positive value followed by a negative value.
(iv) A constant negative value.
(v) A negative value followed by a positive value.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```
(ii) A constant positive value.
```
