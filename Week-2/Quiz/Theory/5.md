<b>Question:</b>
```
Which of the following is not an example of a linear filtering system? 

Let x(t) denote the input signal and y(t) denote the output signal.

(i) y(t)=3x(t)−5x(t−τ), where τ is positive.			
(ii) y(t)=cos[x(t−θ)]
(iii) y(t)=∫∞0e−τx(t−τ)dτ			
(iv) y(t)=∑∞n=0anx(t−nτ), where a is between 0 and 1, and τ is positive.
```
<b>Solution</b>:
```
I find that τ is required for any linear filtering system. I don't see it in (ii).
