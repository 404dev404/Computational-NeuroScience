<b>Question:</b>
```
What is the definition of a spike triggered average for a neuron?

(i) The set of stimuli preceding a spike, each averaged over time.
(ii) The stimuli preceding a spike, averaged over all stimuli that elicited a spike.
(iii) None of these.
(iv) The average time between spikes in a recording.
(v) The set of all stimuli that elicit a spike.
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```
The STA is computed as an average over the spike-triggered ensemble. 

For example, if each stimulus in the spike-triggered ensemble is a 100 ms time-series, 
then the STA will also be a 100 ms time-series.

so, The stimuli preceding a spike, averaged over all stimuli that elicited a spike.
